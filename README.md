# Meteorological Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of meteorological data spanning from 1940 to 2018, with a focus on understanding the variance of Global Meteorological Behavior (GMB) in the Sierra del Brujo region. The analysis explores various climatic indices to provide insights into the changing climate patterns over the years.

## Key Findings

### SDII Variation (Figure 15a)

- Demonstrates a decline of -12 mm in precipitation from 1940 to 2018.

### Number of Icing Days (Figure 15b)

- Indicates a reduction of -0.09 days since 1960.

### Cold Spell Duration Index (Figure 15c)

- Displays a reduction of -8.5 days.

### Day Temperature Range (Figure 15d)

- Shows a decrease of -1.5◦ Celsius from 1940 to 1960.
- Indicates an increase of 1◦ Celsius from 1980 to 2018.

### Seasonal Temperature Extremes (Figure 16)

- TXn increased by 2 degrees Celsius in the summertime.
- TXx exhibited a notable increase in the last decade.
- TNx showed a 4 degrees Celsius decline followed by a one-degree Celsius increase in the last ten years.
- TNn increased around 4 degrees Celsius since 1940.

## Project Details

### Usage

To reproduce the figures and enhance the understanding of climate forcing, consider the following improvements:

1. Combine all plots into a single figure with panels [right, left].
2. Focus on the period from 1960 to 2010, covering the GMB period.
3. Add vertical lines to highlight important dates of DEMs (1955, 1969, 1985, 1997, 2000, 2010).
